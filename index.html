    <H2>Polymer First Element Tutorial</H2>
    <p> This is a minor variant of the Polymer project tutorial (version 1.0) described 
        <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/">here</a>.  I'm not sure how this differs from the Polymer2.0 example.
    </p>
    <p> The links below show the results at various stages of the tutorial.
    
    </p>
    <p>
    The main difference from the referenced tutorial is that there are 
    slight changes to the paths mentioned in <i>&lt;link&gt;</i> and
    <i>&lt;script&gt;</i> tags so that normal server conventions apply,
    rather than the odd conventions used in the polymer server that is
    part of the nodejs polymer-cli system.  These changes appear <i>only</i>
    in the html files modified in the tutotials that appear in
    directories step2, step3, etc.   The underlying files of the
    components that appear in subfolders of the bower_components directory
    are unchanged and copied directly from the tutorial download.
    </p>
    <p> One other difference is that the webcomponentsjs and polymer
     directories in bower_components come from a different source.  I think
     they are from a version of version 2 of the tutorial.  I got them from the
     <i>cold-umbrella</i> example mentioned <a href="https://support.glitch.com/t/how-to-install-polymer-2-0/1270">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Another difference regards a detail of naming in the various 
       directories (step1, step2, etc.)  The original naming of the files in
       the tutorial is: 
       <br/>index.html, icon-toggle.html, icon-toggle-demo.html.
       <br/>These are changed, in the step1 directory to
       <br/>index.html (same), icon-toggle1.html, icon-toggle1-demo.html.
       <br/> Also, within the files, the component names are similarly changed to:
       <br/> icon-toggle1-demo and icon-toggle1.
