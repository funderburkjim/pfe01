Polymer First Element Tutorial

This is an adaptation of the  Polymer project tutorial (version 1.0) described 
        [here](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/).

This is hosted in GitHub pages at [pfe01](https://funderburkjim.github.io/pfe01/index.html).

Note the 'main' branch is named *gh-pages* -- there is no *master* branch.

See [Shiffman's Description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFVtrlyH-kc) of how the repository was set up.


Note that there is no need for nodejs to follow and adapt this application.
Maybe this simplification will allow for easier exploration of the interesting possibilities of Polymer.
